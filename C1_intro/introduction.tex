\firstOcc{IoT} refers to an interconnecting infrastructure to integrate everyday used embedded computing devices. Recently \addac{IoT} is being used for improving the quality of life~\cite{NOUR201995}. In an \addac{IoT}, the number of end-users in a single network can reach up to a million~\cite{iotdeployment} very easily.  Due to this, the global \addac{M2M} traffic is estimated to reach $51\%$~\cite{ipassonline} of the total traffic demand in $2023$. Therefore, \addac{IoT} is estimated to grow as a major technology in the near future. In this thesis, we focus on \firstOcc{LSN}. Like \addac{IoT}, \addac{LSN} also spans from backbone network to edge devices. We identify \addac{LSN} as a \addac{WAN} which is a subset of \addac{IoT}. We make the following key assumptions to segregate \addac{LSN} from \addac{IoT} in this thesis.
\begin{itemize}
\item The \addac{LSN} contains millions of heterogeneous resource constraint \firstOcc{COTS} devices. Each device can have multiple interfaces. The traffic generated by the \addac{LSN} devices is mainly short-flows~\cite{6560419}.
\item Since it is difficult to deploy such a vast network while maintaining single administrative domains, \addac{LSN} spans across multiple administrative domains.
\item By looking at the momentum of virtualization technologies used presently~\cite{10.1145/3341302.3342075}, we firmly believe that virtualization can be an inherent technology used in the future \addac{LSN}.
\end{itemize}

Management of a large scale network like \addac{LSN} presents many improvement opportunities and customization. However, network management in \addac{LSN} is difficult. Unlike \addac{DCN}, \acp{LSN} does not use any standard topology. On the other hand, the participant devices of an \addac{LSN} can be heterogeneous and can generate heterogeneous traffic based on the applications running inside the devices. Therefore, \addac{LSN} deployments require evolutionary network management measure such as \addac{SDN}~\cite{mckeown2008openflow,feamster2014road,nunes2014survey,caesar2005design}.

\addac{SDN} plays a significant role in handling dynamic demands of network management~\cite{clark:1988:dpd:52325.52336} where traditional approaches generally struggle. \addac{SDN} has been developed to ensure dynamic management of network and it relies on \addTerm{control plane} and \addTerm{data plane} separation where control plane responsibilities are assigned to dedicated devices called \addTerm{controller}. \addac{SDN} controllers maintain a logically centralized view of the network and provide programmability through standard \addac{API}. Therefore, \addac{SDN} has the potential to assist system administrators in defining and enforcing dynamic network-wide policies.

However, available \addac{SDN} oriented solutions for existing \addTerm{backbone networks} like \addTerm{enterprise network}~\cite{casado2012fabric,nayak2009resonance,kreutz2015software}, \addac{ISPN} and \addac{DCN}~\cite{yu2011scalable,yu2014palantir,berde2014onos} does not suit well in case of \addac{LSN}. The salient differences between existing backbone networks and \addac{LSN} are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Unlike existing backbone networks, \addac{LSN} does not use costly hardware. Therefore, performance improvement of traffic generated in \addac{LSN} is difficult. \addac{LSN} can be extended to mobile devices also. For example, \addac{IoT} applications can use the idle resources of mobile devices. In such cases, \addac{LSN} provides performance improvement by aggregating resources from multiple such devices that require fine-grained network control over a highly distributed platform.
 \item \addac{LSN} requires higher degree of scalability than \addac{DCN} or \addac{ISPN}. On the other hand, \addac{SDN} supported devices are costly, and it isn't easy to replace all the existing pieces of equipment at a single sweep. Therefore, reduction of \addac{capex} and \addac{opex} is a serious concern in case of a \addac{LSN}.
 \item Since \addac{LSN} can be composed of resource constraint devices and mobile devices, the system is highly dynamic and failure-prone in nature, which rarely happens in the case of \addac{DCN}/\addac{ISPN}.
 \item The existence of heterogeneous devices results in diversified traffic demands. Fine-grained management of these traffic classes requires various types of network-oriented services apart from simple \addac{QoS} management and route selection challenges.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Motivation for This Thesis}
In this thesis, we identify some of the issues related to \addac{SDN} oriented network management of \addac{LSN}. Our research is primarily based on the following questions.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}
\label{C0:Q1}
 \emph{\bf How to improve performance of the applications in an \addac{LSN}?}
\end{question}
        \input{C1_intro/1_mptcp_introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%During this research we found that, even though centralized SDN can improve the performance of \addac{MPTCP}, centralized SDN controllers suffer from scalability issues. The scalability issue arises when the number of devices increase in the eco-system, the centralized controller becomes bottleneck itself and requires larger time to respond. The effect of scalability issue reduces the performance of \addac{IoT} which compelled us to investigate the second question.
