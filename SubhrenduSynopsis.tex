\section{Organization of The Thesis}
  \acresetall
The organization of the final thesis is as follows.
\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Chapter 1: Introduction}\\
	Discusses the recent advances in \addac{LSN}, motivation, and problem definition for the thesis.
\item \textbf{Chapter 2: Background}\\
	Discusses the important pre-requisites and definitions which are used in the thesis.
\item \textbf{Chapter 3: SDN-MPTCP: MPTCP Sub-Flow Management Over \addac{LSN}}\\
	Proposes \paperName{SDN-MPTCP} which improves performance of \addac{MPTCP} based transport protocol executing on top of \addac{LSN} by providing Sub-Flow management framework to reduce \emph{``Out-of-order"} segments.
\item \textbf{Chapter 4: Flipper: Dynamic NIB Placement For Distributed SDN}\\
	Proposes \paperName{FLIPPER} architecture which reduces \addac{capex}/\addac{opex} challenge by employing \addac{SDN} like control on top of \addac{COTS} devices.
\item \textbf{Chapter 5: Aloe: An Elastic Auto-Scaled and Self-stabilized Orchestration Framework for \addac{LSN} Applications}\\
	Extends \paperName{FLIPPER} principle to develop an auto-scalable and light weight fault-tolerant distributed control plane for management of \addac{LSN}.
\item \textbf{Chapter 6: Amalgam: Distributed Network Control With Scalable Service Chaining}\\
	Enhances \paperName{Aloe} to exploit \addac{INP} framework of \addac{LSN} to ensure a scalable \addac{SFC} management by integrating distributed network control and distributed service function chain management.
\item \textbf{Chapter 7: Conclusion and Future Work}\\
	Concludes the thesis with pointing to future works.
