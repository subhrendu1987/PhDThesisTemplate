This thesis would not have been complete without the support of my thesis supervisor \textit{Prof. Sukumar Nandi} and my mentor \textit{Dr. Sandip Chakraborty}. Both of them have provided their support, knowledge and guidance to help me in my research. I have been working with both of them from my early days of M.Tech. I am truly grateful to them for putting me back in track during the trying times of my PhD. I have also learned many things about life while having a discussion with them. Their constant support and positive criticism have influenced my attitude, nature and personality in many ways.

I am very thankful to my doctoral committee members \textit{Prof. Diganta Goswami}, \textit{Prof. Ratnajit Bhattacharya} and \textit{Dr. Tamarapalli Venkatesh} for understanding my works and providing valuable comments to improve the work. I express my sincere thanks to former \textit{Head of the Department} \textit{Prof. S.B. Nair} and \textit{Prof. S.V. Rao} and current \textit{Head of the Department} \textit{Prof. Jatindra Deka} for providing a nice research environment in the \textit{Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IITG} and support my research work in many ways. During my early stages of research I enjoyed discussion with \textit{Dr. Sushanta Karmakar} and \textit{Dr. Arnab Sarkar} who helped and motivated me in a lot of ways. I am forever grateful for their support and time.

I am also very grateful to \textit{Tata Consultancy Services India Private Limited} for awarding me the research fellowship that gave me extremely good opportunities to broaden my research activities and interact with eminent researchers in the world, both from the industry as well from the academia. I thank \textit{Mr. Sachin Parkhi}, \textit{Program Manager of TCS Research Scholar Program}, for extending their helps and supports in technical and official activities. 

I had the privilege to collaborate with \textit{Dr. Sushanta Karmakar}, \textit{Dr. Samar Shailendra}, \textit{Prof. Soumya Kanti Ghosh} and \textit{Dr. Abhinandan S Prasad} whose interest and knowledge has enriched me a lot. I also enjoyed working with \textit{Dr. Niladri Sett}, \textit{Mr. Soumyajit Chatterjee} and \textit{Mr. Shubabrata Nath}. I express my sincere gratitude towards \textit{Mr. Debasish Naskar} for designing the logos and cover page of this thesis.

I would also like to express my hearty gratitude to \textit{Prof. Gautam Barua} and \textit{Prof. Gautam Biswas} the past Directors of the institute,  \textit{Prof. T. G. Sitharam} the present Director of the institute, all the Deans and other officials of IIT Guwahati, whose collective efforts have made this institute a place for world-class studies and research. I am thankful to all the faculties and the staffs of the Department of Computer science and Engineering for extending their cooperation in terms of technical and official supports. I thank the research scholars, M. Tech and the B. Tech students of this institute, with whom I have closely worked. I am sorry for not to mention all of their names, however, I have learned a lot from them during the course of our discussions.


I am forever thankful to \textit{Rahul, Soumadip, Akash, Mandar} and \textit{Ujjal} for the countless coffee sessions and round of discussions on various topics of interests which I will be missing in my upcoming days. My sincere thanks to my lab-mates \textit{Pranav, Madhurima, Pradeep, Debanjan, Kangan} and \textit{Sikha} for providing me a healthy work environment and helping me out during my needs. I am thankful to \textit{Bennith and Suraj} who helped me to develop experimentation frameworks.

Last, but not least, I probably would not have done a PhD were it not for my parents. From the childhood they have encouraged me to raise questions and indulged my curiosities. Many of the things I appreciate in research can be traced back to an idealized version of what my parents said while I was growing up. While, I often disagree with
them on issues, everything I do is influenced by them. My wife \textit{Piyali} also helped me in writing and proof reading this thesis. Her constant support has helped me a lot in writing this thesis.

Finally, there are several collaborators and anonymous reviewers who are not listed out explicitly, but who had an impact on my experience in grad school: people who enabled me to solve new problems, find new topics, and just meet new people. This acknowledgement was getting too long to list everyone, but know that all of you made a huge difference.
